        A third deathly and decadent book in the  New York Times  bestselling Belladonna series is here.<br>        #1 New York Times bestselling author Adalyn Grace delivers a sensational conclusion to the deathly and decadent Belladonna trilogy, with dramatic twists and a seductive new romance that will set readers' hearts ablaze.

Blythe Hawthorn has never let anyone tell her what to do—not society, not her overprotective father, and certainly not the man she’s bound herself to, no matter how rude and insufferable he is.<br> In fact, she’s determined to be a thorn in his side for the rest of her days, even as he ensures that her new life in his palace is anything but a fairytale. But as Blythe discovers a new side to herself that links her to his past, she’ll have to ask herself if she’s willing to let an unexpected spark ignite…and if she’s willing to discover the truth about her past.
